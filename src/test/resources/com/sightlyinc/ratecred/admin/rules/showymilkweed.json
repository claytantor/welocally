No big deal as he could have been making a reservation, but then i noticed during my many attempts to wave down our server that he was on the phone all night.  Our server had a hipster im so cool attitude that was rteally annoying.  The margaritas were really weak and tasted like minute maid lemonade.  I was served the wrong dish, but just ate it as i couldnt get servers attention to send them back.  My friend warned me the place is hit or miss and she was right.  You should check it out for the design, but be warned about the total experience.",
